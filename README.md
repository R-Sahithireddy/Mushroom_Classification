# Mushroom Classification üçÑ

## Problem Statement: <br>
Identifying mushrooms can be tricky, and some can even be poisonous. This project tackles the challenge of creating a computer program that can tell us if a mushroom is edible or not based on its characteristics.

## Dataset Description: <br>
We're using a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about various features of mushrooms. These features include things like the size, shape, and color of the cap, details about the gill and stalk, and other attributes. The main goal is to predict whether a mushroom is safe to eat or not.
